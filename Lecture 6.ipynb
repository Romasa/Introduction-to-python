Lists are defined in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of objects in square brackets (\\[ \\]), as shown below\n","```\n","  var = [1, 'alpha', 3.25]\n","```\n","Important characteristics of Python lists are as follows:\n","\n","**Lists are Ordered**: A list is not merely a collection of objects. It is an ordered collection of objects. The order in which you specify the elements when you define a list is an innate characteristic of that list and is maintained for that list’s lifetime. Lists that have the same elements in a different order are not the same.\n","```\n","  var_one = [1, 'alpha', 3.25]\n","  var_two = [1, 3.25, 'alpha']\n","  print(var_one == var_two)\n","```\n","\n","**Lists can Contain any Arbitrary Objects**: A list can contain any assortment of objects. The elements of a list can all be the same type,\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3]\n","```\n","Or the elements can be of varying types,\n","```\n","  var = [1, 'alpha', 3.25]\n","```\n","Lists can even contain complex objects, like functions, classes, and modules. List objects needn’t be unique. A given object can appear in a list multiple times\n","```\n","  var = [1, 1, 1]\n","```\n","\n","**List Elements can be Accessed by Index**: Individual elements in a list can be accessed using an index in square brackets. This is exactly analogous to accessing individual characters in a string. List indexing is zero-based as it is with strings.\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta']\n","  print(var[0])\n","  print(var[1])\n","  print(var[2])\n","```\n","Virtually everything about string indexing works similarly for lists. For example, a negative list index counts from the end of the list\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta']\n","  print(var[-3])\n","  print(var[-2])\n","  print(var[-1])\n","```\n","Slicing also works. If var is a list, the expression var[m:n] returns the portion of a from index m to, but not including, index n\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta', 2]\n","  print(var[1:3])\n","```\n","Both positive and negative indices can be specified\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta', 2]\n","  print(var[1:2] == var[-3:-1])\n","```\n","Omitting the first index starts the slice at the beginning of the list, and omitting the second index extends the slice to the end of the list\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta', 2]\n","  print(var[:4], var[0:4])\n","  print(var[2:], var[2:len(var)])\n","```\n","You can specify a stride—either positive or negative\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta', 2]\n","  print(var[0:4:2])\n","  print(var[3:0:-2])\n","```\n","The syntax for reversing a list works the same way it does for strings\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta', 2]\n","  print(var[::-1])\n","```\n","If s is a string, s\\[:\\] returns a reference to the same object\n","```\n","  var = 'alpha'\n","  print(var[:] is var)\n","```\n","if a is a list, a\\[:\\] returns a new object that is a copy of a\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', 1, 'beta', 2]\n","  print(var[:] is var)\n","```\n","Several Python operators and built-in functions can also be used with lists in ways that are analogous to strings\n","```\n","  var = [ 1, 2, 2]\n","  print('beta' in var)\n","  print('beta' not in var)\n","  print(var + ['gamma'])\n","  print(var * 2)\n","  print(len(var))\n","  print(min(var))\n","  print(max(var))\n","```\n","\n","**Lists can be Nested to Arbitrary Depth**: You have seen that an element in a list can be any sort of object. That includes another list. A list can contain sublists, which in turn can contain sublists themselves, and so on to arbitrary depth. To access the items in a sublist, simply append an additional index\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', [1,'beta'], 2]\n","  print(var[1][1])\n","```\n","There is no limit, short of the extent of your computer’s memory, to the depth or complexity with which lists can be nested in this way.\n","\n","**Lists are mutable**: Integer or float objects are primitive units that can’t be further broken down. These types are immutable, meaning that they can’t be changed once they have been assigned. It doesn’t make much sense to think of changing the value of an integer. If you want a different integer, you just assign a different one.\n","\n","By contrast, the string type is a composite type. Strings are reducible to smaller parts—the component characters. It might make sense to think of changing the characters in a string. But you can’t. In Python, strings are also immutable.\n","\n","The list is a mutable data type. Once a list has been created, elements can be added, deleted, shifted, and moved around at will. Python provides a wide range of ways to modify lists.\n","\n","A single value in a list can be replaced by indexing and simple assignment.\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', [1,'beta'], 2]\n","  print(var)\n","  var[1] = 5\n","  print(var[2])\n","```\n","A list item can be deleted with the del command\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', [1,'beta'], 2]\n","  del var[1]\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","If you want to change several contiguous elements in a list at one time then you can do this with slice assignment, which has the following syntax\n","```\n","  var[m:n] = <iterable>\n","```\n","```\n","  var = ['alpha', [1,'beta'], 2]\n","  print(var[0:2])\n","  var[0:2] = [1,2]\n","```\n","The number of elements inserted need not be equal to the number replaced. Python just grows or shrinks the list as needed.\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3]\n","  print(var[0:2])\n","  var[1:2] = [4,5,6]\n","```\n","You can also insert elements into a list without removing anything. Simply specify a slice of the form \\[n:n\\] (a zero-length slice) at the desired index\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3]\n","  print(var[0:2])\n","  var[1:1] = [4,5,6]\n","```\n","You can delete multiple elements out of the middle of a list by assigning the appropriate slice to an empty list. You can also use the del statement with the same slice\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var[1:3] = []\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","Additional items can be added to the start or end of a list using the + concatenation operator or the += augmented assignment operator\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var += [6, 7, 8]\n","  print(var)\n","  var = [0] + var\n","```\n","Note that a list must be concatenated with another list, so if you want to add only one element, you need to specify it as a singleton list.\n","\n","Finally, Python supplies several built-in methods that can be used to modify lists. Information on these methods is detailed below\n","\n","Append an object to a list.\n","```\n","  var.append(<obj>)\n","```\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var.append(6)\n","  print(var)\n","  var.append([7, 8])\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","Remember, list methods modify the target list in place. They do not return a new list\n","\n","Extend a list with the objects from an iterable.\n","```\n","  var.extend(<iterable>)\n","```\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var.append([7, 8])\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","In other words, .extend() behaves like the + operator.\n","\n","Insert an object into a list.\n","```\n","  var.insert(<index>, <obj>)\n","```\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var.insert(2,10)\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","Remove an object from a list.\n","```\n","  var.remove(<obj>)\n","```\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var.remove(4)\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","if \\<obj\\> isn’t in var, an exception is raised\n","\n","Remove an element from a list.\n","```\n","  var.pop(index=-1)\n","```\n","```\n","  var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  var.pop()\n","  print(var)\n","  var.pop(1)\n","  print(var)\n","```\n","**Lists are dynamic**: When items are added to a list, it grows as needed."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XBZ_pH0SI3EZ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1626979742164,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":911,"user":{"displayName":"Md.

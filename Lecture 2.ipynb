Let’s take a look at each component in more depth.\n","\n","**\\<name>** indicates which argument from the argument list is inserted into the Python format string in the given location. It’s either a number for a positional argument or a keyword for a keyword argument. \n","\n","By default, the Python .format() method uses str(), but in some instances, you may want to force .format() to use one of repr() or ascii(). You can do this with the **\\<conversion>** component of a replacement field. \n","\n","\n","The **\\<format_spec>** component is the last portion of a replacement field\n","```\n","  {[\\<name>][!\\<conversion>][:\\<format_spec>]}\n","```\n","\\<format_spec> represents the guts of the Python .format() method’s functionality. It contains information that exerts fine control over how values are formatted prior to being inserted into the template string.

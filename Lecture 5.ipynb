The \\<statement(s)> in the loop body are denoted by indentation, as with all Python control structures, and are executed once for each item in \\<iterable>. The loop variable \\<var> takes on the value of the next element in \\<iterable> each time through the loop.\n","\n","**Iterables**\n","\n","In Python, iterable means an object can be used in iteration. \n","\n","1. An adjective: An object may be described as iterable.\n","\n","2. A noun: An object may be characterized as an iterable.\n","\n","If an object is iterable, it can be passed to the built-in Python function iter(), which returns something called an iterator. Yes, the terminology gets a bit repetitive. Hang in there. It all works out in the end.\n","\n","All the data types that are collection or container types are iterable. These include the string, list, tuple, dict, set, and frozenset types.\n","\n","But these are by no means the only types that you can iterate over. Many objects that are built into Python or defined in modules are designed to be iterable. For example, open files in Python are iterable. As you will see soon in the tutorial on file I/O, iterating over an open file object reads data from the file.\n","\n","In fact, almost any object in Python can be made iterable. Even user-defined objects can be designed in such a way that they can be iterated over. \n","\n","**Iterators**\n","\n","Okay, now you know what it means for an object to be iterable, and you know how to use iter() to obtain an iterator from it. \n","\n","An iterator is essentially a value producer that yields successive values from its associated iterable object. The built-in function next() is used to obtain the next value from in iterator.\n","\n","```\n","  a = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma']\n","  itr = iter(a)\n","  print(next(itr))\n","```\n","\n","Here, a is an iterable list and itr is the associated iterator, obtained with iter(). Each next(itr) call obtains the next value from itr. An iterator retains its state internally. It knows which values have been obtained already, so when you call next(), it knows what value to return next. If all the values from an iterator have been returned already, a subsequent next() call raises a StopIteration exception. Any further attempts to obtain values from the iterator will fail. You can only obtain values from an iterator in one direction. You can’t go backward. \n","\n","Now, consider again the simple for loop presented at the start. To carry out the iteration for loop does the following,\n","\n","1. Calls iter() to obtain an iterator for a\n","2. Calls next() repeatedly to obtain each item from the iterator in turn\n","3. Terminates the loop when next() raises the StopIteration exception\n","\n","The loop body is executed once for each item next() returns, with loop variable i set to the given item for each iteration.\n","\n","**The range() Function**\n","\n","For example, if you wanted to iterate through the values from 0 to 5, you could simply do this\n","\n","```\n","  for i in (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):\n","    print(n)\n","```\n","\n","This solution isn’t too bad when there are just a few numbers. But if the number range were much larger, it would become tedious pretty quickly.\n","\n","Happily, Python provides a better option—the built-in range() function, which returns an iterable that yields a sequence of integers.\n","\n","range(\\<end>) returns an iterable that yields integers starting with 0, up to but not including \\<end>.\n","\n","\n","Note that range() returns an object of class range, not a list or tuple of the values. Because a range object is an iterable, you can obtain the values by iterating over them with a for loop\n","\n","You could also snag all the values at once with list() or tuple(). In a REPL session, that can be a convenient way to quickly display what the values are\n","\n","```\n","  output = range(5)\n","  print(list(output))\n","```\n","\n","However, when range() is used in code that is part of a larger application, it is typically considered poor practice to use list() or tuple() in this way. \n","\n","range(\\<begin>, \\<end>, \\<stride>) returns an iterable that yields integers starting with \\<begin>, up to but not including \\<end>. If specified, \\<stride> indicates an amount to skip between values (analogous to the stride value used for string and list slicing).\n","\n","**break** and **continue** work the same way with for loops as with while loops. break terminates the loop completely and proceeds to the first statement following the loop.\n","\n","```\n","  for i in ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma']:\n","    if 't' in i:\n","      break\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","\n","```\n","  for i in ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma']:\n","    if 't' in i:\n","      continue\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","\n","A for loop can have an else clause as well.

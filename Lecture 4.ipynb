Without indentation, Python does not know which statement to execute next or which statement belongs to which block. This will lead to **IndentationError**. Python indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code. \n","\n","A **Block** is a combination of statements. Block can be regarded as the grouping of statements for a specific purpose. Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. \n","\n","Python uses indentation to highlight the blocks of code. Whitespace is used for indentation in Python. All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right. You can understand it better by looking at the following lines of code.\n","\n","Python uses 4 spaces as indentation by default.

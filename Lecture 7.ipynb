A function is a relationship or mapping between one or more inputs and a set of outputs. \n","\n","In programming, a function is a self-contained block of code that encapsulates a specific task or related group of tasks. \n","\n","len() returns the length of the argument passed to it.\n","\n","```\n","  var = [0,1,2,3]\n","  print(len(var))\n","```\n","\n","Each of the built-in functions performs a specific task. The code that accomplishes the task is defined somewhere, but you don’t need to know where or even how the code works. All you need to know about is the function’s interface\n","\n","1. What arguments (if any) it takes\n","2. What values (if any) it returns\n","\n","Then you call the function and pass the appropriate arguments. Program execution goes off to the designated body of code and does its useful thing. When the function is finished, execution returns to your code where it left off. The function may or may not return data for your code to use, as the examples above do.\n","\n","When you define your own Python function, it works just the same. From somewhere in your code, you’ll call your Python function and program execution will transfer to the body of code that makes up the function.\n","\n","When the function is finished, execution returns to the location where the function was called. Depending on how you designed the function’s interface, data may be passed in when the function is called, and return values may be passed back when it finishes.\n","\n","\n","Importance of Functions\n","\n","**Abstraction and Reusability**\n","\n","Suppose you write some code that does something useful. As you continue development, you find that the task performed by that code is one you need often, in many different locations within your application. What should you do? Well, you could just replicate the code over and over again, using your editor’s copy-and-paste capability.\n","\n","Later on, you’ll probably decide that the code in question needs to be modified. You’ll either find something wrong with it that needs to be fixed, or you’ll want to enhance it in some way. If copies of the code are scattered all over your application, then you’ll need to make the necessary changes in every location.\n","\n","A better solution is to define a Python function that performs the task. Anywhere in your application that you need to accomplish the task, you simply call the function. Down the line, if you decide to change how it works, then you only need to change the code in one location, which is the place where the function is defined. The changes will automatically be picked up anywhere the function is called.\n","\n","The abstraction of functionality into a function definition is an example of the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle of software development. This is arguably the strongest motivation for using functions.\n","\n","**Modularity**\n","\n","Functions allow complex processes to be broken up into smaller steps. Imagine, for example, that you have a program that reads in a file, processes the file contents, and then writes an output file. Your code could look like this:\n","\n","```\n","  # Main program\n","\n","  # Code to read file in\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","\n","  # Code to process file\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","\n","  # Code to write file out\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","  <statement>\n","```\n","\n","In this example, the main program is a bunch of code strung together in a long sequence, with whitespace and comments to help organize it. However, if the code were to get much lengthier and more complex, then you’d have an increasingly difficult time wrapping your head around it.\n","\n","Alternatively, you could structure the code more like the following:\n","\n","```\n","  def read_file():\n","      # Code to read file in\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","\n","  def process_file():\n","      # Code to process file\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","\n","\n","  def write_file():\n","      # Code to write file out\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","      <statement>\n","\n","  # Main program\n","  read_file()\n","  process_file()\n","  write_file()\n","```\n","\n","This example is modularized. Instead of all the code being strung together, it’s broken out into separate functions, each of which focuses on a specific task. Those tasks are read, process, and write. The main program now simply needs to call each of these in turn.\n","\n","**Namespace Separation**\n","\n","A namespace is a region of a program in which identifiers have meaning. As you’ll see below, when a Python function is called, a new namespace is created for that function, one that is distinct from all other namespaces that already exist.\n","\n","The practical upshot of this is that variables can be defined and used within a Python function even if they have the same name as variables defined in other functions or in the main program. In these cases, there will be no confusion or interference because they’re kept in separate namespaces.\n","\n","This means that when you write code within a function, you can use variable names and identifiers without worrying about whether they’re already used elsewhere outside the function. This helps minimize errors in code considerably."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jspqV6YbcMqy"},"source":["**Function Calls and Definition**\n","\n","---\n","\n","The usual syntax for defining a Python function is as follows\n","\n","```\n","  def <function_name>([<parameters>]):\n","      <statement(s)>\n","```\n","\n","1. **def**\tThe keyword that informs Python that a function is being defined\n","2. **\\<function_name\\>**\tA valid Python identifier that names the function\n","3. **\\<parameters\\>**\tAn optional, comma-separated list of parameters that may be passed to the function\n","4. **:**\tPunctuation that denotes the end of the Python function header (the name and parameter list)\n","5. **\\<statement(s)\\>**\tA block of valid Python statements. This is called the body of the function. The body of a Python function is defined by indentation in accordance with the off-side rule. This is the same as code blocks associated with a control structure, like an if or while statement.\n","\n","The syntax for calling a Python function is as follows\n","\n","```\n","  <function_name>([<arguments>])\n","```\n","\n","\\<arguments\\> are the values passed into the function. They correspond to the \\<parameters\\> in the Python function definition. You can define a function that doesn’t take any arguments, but the parentheses are still required. Both a function definition and a function call must always include parentheses, even if they’re empty.\n","\n","```\n","  def fun():\n","    print('This is a Sample Function')\n","\n","  fun()\n","```\n","\n","Occasionally, you may want to define an empty function that does nothing. This is referred to as a stub, which is usually a temporary placeholder for a Python function that will be fully implemented at a later time. Just as a block in a control structure can’t be empty, neither can the body of a function. To define a stub function, use the **pass** statement\n","\n","```\n","  def fun():\n","    pass\n","\n","  fun()\n","```\n","\n","As you can see above, a call to a stub function is syntactically valid but doesn’t do anything.\n","\n","Argument Passing\n","So far in this tutorial, the functions you’ve defined haven’t taken any arguments. That can sometimes be useful, and you’ll occasionally write such functions. More often, though, you’ll want to pass data into a function so that its behavior can vary from one invocation to the next. Let’s see how to do that.\n","\n","Positional Arguments\n","The most straightforward way to pass arguments to a Python function is with positional arguments (also called required arguments). In the function definition, you specify a comma-separated list of parameters inside the parentheses.\n","\n","**Argument Passing**\n","\n","1. **Positional Arguments**: The most straightforward way to pass arguments to a Python function is with positional arguments (also called required arguments). In the function definition, you specify a comma-separated list of parameters inside the parentheses\n","```\n","  def fun(alpha, beta, gamma):\n","    print(alpha,beta,gamma)\n","\n","  fun('fist','second','third')\n","```\n","The parameters (alpha, beta, and gamma) behave like variables that are defined locally to the function. When the function is called, the arguments that are passed ('fist','second','third') are bound to the parameters in order, as though by variable assignment\n","<br>\n","Although positional arguments are the most straightforward way to pass data to a function, they also afford the least flexibility. For starters, the order of the arguments in the call must match the order of the parameters in the definition. There’s nothing to stop you from specifying positional arguments out of order, of course.\n","<br>\n","With positional arguments, the arguments in the call and the parameters in the definition must agree not only in order but in number as well. That’s the reason positional arguments are also referred to as required arguments. You can’t leave any out when calling the function\n","2. **Keyword Arguments**: When you’re calling a function, you can specify arguments in the form \\<keyword\\>=\\<value\\>. In that case, each \\<keyword\\> must match a parameter in the Python function definition. For example, the previously defined function fun() may be called with keyword arguments as follows\n","```\n","  def fun(alpha, beta, gamma):\n","    print(alpha,beta,gamma)\n","\n","  fun(beta = 'fist',alpha ='second',gamma='third')\n","```\n","Using keyword arguments lifts the restriction on argument order. Each keyword argument explicitly designates a specific parameter by name, so you can specify them in any order and Python will still know which argument goes with which parameter.\n","<br>\n","Like with positional arguments, though, the number of arguments and parameters must still match.\n","3. **Default Parameters**: If a parameter specified in a Python function definition has the form \\<name\\>=\\<value\\>, then \\<value\\> becomes a default value for that parameter. Parameters defined this way are referred to as default or optional parameters. \n","```\n","  def fun(alpha = 'first', beta, gamma):\n","    print(alpha,beta,gamma)\n","\n","  fun(beta = 'fist', gamma='third')\n","```\n","**Mutable Default Parameter Values**: Things can get weird if you specify a default parameter value that is a mutable object. Consider this Python function definition\n","```\n","  def fun(my_list=[]):\n","    my_list.append('*')\n","    return my_list\n","  print(fun())\n","```\n","fun() takes a single list parameter, appends the string '\\*' to the end of the list, and returns the result. The default value for parameter my_list is the empty list, so if fun() is called without any arguments, then the return value is a list with the single element '\\*'\n","<br>\n","Now, what would you expect to happen if f() is called without any parameters a second and a third time?\n","\n","Oops! You might have expected each subsequent call to also return the singleton list ['###'], just like the first. Instead, the return value keeps growing. What happened?\n","<br>\n","In Python, default parameter values are defined only once when the function is defined (that is, when the def statement is executed). The default value isn’t re-defined each time the function is called. Thus, each time you call fun() without a parameter, you’re performing .append() on the same list.\n","<br>\n","Since lists are mutable, each subsequent .append() call causes the list to get longer. This is a common and pretty well-documented pitfall when you’re using a mutable object as a parameter’s default value. It potentially leads to confusing code behavior, and is probably best avoided.\n","<br>\n","As a workaround, consider using a default argument value that signals no argument has been specified. Most any value would work, but None is a common choice. When the sentinel value indicates no argument is given, create a new empty list inside the function\n","```\n","  def fun(my_list=None):\n","    if my_list is None:\n","      my_list = []\n","    my_list.append('*')\n","    return my_list\n","```\n","\n","**In summary**\n","\n","1. Positional arguments must agree in order and number with the parameters declared in the function definition.\n","2. Keyword arguments must agree with declared parameters in number, but they may be specified in arbitrary order.\n","3. Default parameters allow some arguments to be omitted when the function is called.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Pass-By-Value vs Pass-By-Reference**\n","\n","In programming language design, there are two common paradigms for passing an argument to a function:\n","\n","1. **Pass-by-value**: A copy of the argument is passed to the function.\n","\n","2. **Pass-by-reference**: A reference to the argument is passed to the function.\n","\n","\n","\n","Recall that in Python, every piece of data is an object. A reference points to an object, not a specific memory location. That means assignment isn’t interpreted the same way in Python as it is in Pascal. Argument passing in Python is somewhat of a hybrid between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference. What gets passed to the function is a reference to an object, but the reference is passed by value.\n","\n","Are parameters in Python pass-by-value or pass-by-reference? The answer is they’re neither, exactly. That’s because a reference doesn’t mean quite the same thing in Python as it does in Pascal.\n","\n","**Argument Passing Summary**:\n","1. Passing an immutable object, like an int, str, tuple, or frozenset, to a Python function acts like pass-by-value. The function can’t modify the object in the calling environment.\n","```\n","  def fun(x):\n","    print(\"Value of inner 'x' inside the function before change is: {}\".format(x))\n","    x = 10\n","    print(\"Value of inner 'x' inside the function after change is: {}\".format(x))\n","\n","  x = 5\n","  print(\"Value of 'x' before the function call is: {}\".format(x))\n","  fun(x)\n","  print(\"Value of 'x' after the function call is: {}\".format(x))\n","```\n","2. Passing a mutable object such as a list, dict, or set acts somewhat—but not exactly—like pass-by-reference. The function can’t reassign the object wholesale, but it can change items in place within the object, and these changes will be reflected in the calling environment.\n","```\n","  def fun(x):\n","    print(\"Value of inner 'x' inside the function before change is: {}\".format(x))\n","    x[1] = 10\n","    print(\"Value of inner 'x' inside the function after change is: {}\".format(x))\n","\n","  x = [1,2,3]\n","  print(\"Value of 'x' before the function call is: {}\".format(x))\n","  fun(x)\n","  print(\"Value of 'x' after the function call is: {}\".format(x))\n","```\n","\n","**Side Effects**\n","\n","So, in Python, it’s possible for you to modify an argument from within a function so that the change is reflected in the calling environment. But should you do this? This is an example of what’s referred to in programming lingo as a side effect.\n","\n","More generally, a Python function is said to cause a side effect if it modifies its calling environment in any way. Changing the value of a function argument is just one of the possibilities.\n","\n","**The return Statement**\n","\n","What’s a Python function to do then? After all, in many cases, if a function doesn’t cause some change in the calling environment, then there isn’t much point in calling it at all. How should a function affect its caller?\n","\n","Well, one possibility is to use function return values. A return statement in a Python function serves two purposes.\n","\n","1. It immediately terminates the function and passes execution control back to the caller.\n","2. It provides a mechanism by which the function can pass data back to the caller.\n","\n","1. **Exiting a Function**: Within a function, a return statement causes immediate exit from the Python function and transfer of execution back to the caller.\n","\n","```\n","  def fun():\n","    print('Inside the Function')\n","    return\n","```\n","\n","A function will return to the caller when it falls off the end—that is, after the last statement of the function body is executed. So, this function would behave identically without the return statement.\n","<br>\n","However, return statements don’t need to be at the end of a function. They can appear anywhere in a function body, and even multiple times. \n","```\n","  def fun(x):\n","    if x%2 == 0:\n","      return\n","    print('Inside the Function')\n","    return\n","```\n","2. **Returning Data to the Caller**: In addition to exiting a function, the return statement is also used to pass data back to the caller. If a return statement inside a Python function is followed by an expression, then in the calling environment, the function call evaluates to the value of that expression\n","```\n","  def fun():\n","    print('Inside the Function')\n","    return 'alpha'\n","\n","  value = fun()\n","```\n","A function can return any type of object. In Python, that means pretty much anything whatsoever. In the calling environment, the function call can be used syntactically in any way that makes sense for the type of object the function returns.\n","\n","When no return value is given, a Python function returns the special Python value None. The same thing happens if the function body doesn’t contain a return statement at all and the function falls off the end.\n","\n","**Variable-Length Argument Lists**\n","\n","In some cases, when you’re defining a function, you may not know beforehand how many arguments you’ll want it to take. Suppose, for example, that you want to write a Python function that computes the average of several values. You could start with something like this\n","\n","```\n","  def average(a, b, c):\n","    return (a + b + c)/3\n","\n","  value = average()\n","\n","```\n","\n","However, as you’ve already seen, when positional arguments are used, the number of arguments passed must agree with the number of parameters declared. Clearly then, all isn’t well with this implementation of average() for any number of values other than three.\n","\n","**incomplete**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6AxMdPvcJgRg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627481825079,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Md.
